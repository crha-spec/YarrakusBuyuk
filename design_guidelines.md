I understand you rejected the housing app idea and want something different. However, you haven't yet told me what you'd like instead.

**Could you please describe what kind of application or project you'd like me to create design guidelines for?**

For example:
- A different type of app (e.g., fitness tracker, recipe manager, task organizer)
- A website (e.g., portfolio, blog, business site, landing page)
- A specific tool or service

Once you tell me what you want, I'll create comprehensive design guidelines for that project immediately.
